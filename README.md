# Kata - Sharpen those Skills

This project consists of various random kata, most sourced from leetcode. There are some in the
_beg_ and _intermediate_ packages, but the main focus has shifted to "The Sixty", a curated list of 
interview questions that I pulled from Medium, along with a very nice google spreadsheet for 
tracking. These tests/classes are located in the _thesixty_ package, and [the tracking document](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TuvG3C3CdK3JT71xFP-_jnE1WAq6aR1jnirY7JuV5xE/edit#gid=0)
can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TuvG3C3CdK3JT71xFP-_jnE1WAq6aR1jnirY7JuV5xE/edit#gid=0).
