Initially started this project for random kata, but I have since refined my thinking and would like to source the katas directly from leetcode, classifying
each under a beginner, intermediate, or advanced topic for easier tracking and review. Further, leetcode has valuable analysis and insight that can be
reviewed when revisiting a problem.
